Users can enter different types of information about their purchase in the main view: the price, the amount off (a flat value), the discount (a %), other discounts (a %), and tax (%).

The original price and discounted price will be calculated and displayed on any exit of textboxes, from either a tap outside of one or by a press of Return/Done.

Swiping left takes the user to a graphical view of the price, the discounted price, and the net amount saved. Swiping right returns the user to the initial view.
